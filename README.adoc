= Dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files that are used to customize and personalize your system.
These files typically start with a period (or "dot") and are hidden by default in your file system.
They are used to store settings for a wide range of applications, from your terminal to your text editor and beyond.

Managing these dotfiles can be a challenge, especially if you have multiple systems or if you want to share your configuration with others.
One tool that can help with this task is link:http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[GNU Stow].
Stow is a command-line utility that allows you to manage your dotfiles in a simple and organized way.

Here's how to use Stow to manage your dotfiles:

Install Stow on your system.
On most systems, this can be done using your package manager.
For example, to install GNU Stow on macOS, you can use the link:https://brew.sh/[Homebrew package manager]:

[.language="shell"]
----
brew install stow
----

Create a directory to store your dotfiles.
This is where Stow will look for the files that you want to manage.
I would recommend to create a directory called dotfiles in your _home_ directory:

[.language="shell"]
----
mkdir ~/dotfiles
----

Move your dotfiles into the dotfiles directory.
For example, if you want to manage your .bashrc file, you would move it into the dotfiles directory like this:

[.language="shell"]
----
mkdir ~/dotfiles/zsh
mv ~/.zshrc ~/dotfiles/zsh
----

Use Stow to create symlinks for your dotfiles.
This will create a link from the dotfiles directory to the appropriate location in your home directory.
For example, to create a symlink for your .zshrc file, you would use the following command:

[.language="shell"]
----
stow zsh
----

This will create a symlink for the .zshrc file in the dotfiles/zsh directory.

Using Stow to manage your dotfiles has several benefits:

1. It allows you to keep your dotfiles organized and separate from other files on your system.
This makes it easy to find and manage your configuration files.

2. Stow allows you to easily share your dotfiles with others.
For example, you can version your dotfiles using a version control system like Git, and then share them with others on platforms like GitHub.

3. Stow makes it easy to switch between different configurations on different systems.
For example, you could have a separate set of dotfiles for your work and personal systems, and easily switch between them using Stow.
